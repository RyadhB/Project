Creation of a loyalty token for the Casino Group - Project directed by Maurin Yohan

- What will be the value?
<br> Our token is called Caz. Plus, 5 Caz = $ 1. </ Br>

- Who will issue it?
<br> Caz is a loyalty point issued by the Casino Group. (I.e by Monoprix, Franprix, Giant, Naturalia and Small Casino)
When you checkout, each 10 $ spent you earn one Caz token. </ Br>

- How much?
<br> The Casino Group will issue 2 million tokens at the beginning. </ br>

- Will it be possible to create new ones?
<br> No, no other Tokens will be created. </ Br>

- Will it be possible to destroy it?
<br> No, because even when they are used by people to have a discount on their shopping, they will be sent to the address of the Casino Group.
As a result, Casino will always have tokens. </ Br>

- Will it have to be authenticated to have one? to transmit it? If yes by whom?
<br> You have to be a casino customer to get one. A person will be able to transmit these points of fidelity to anybody, it will be enough for him to know his address.
We can make an API or a mobile application for people to enter the address to which they want to send tokens, there will be need to scan a QR code to send the tokens (what casino will do in cash). similar to how the Jaxx application works. In addition, the back end of the application retrieves the 2 addresses and interacts with the smart contract to transfer the token. </ Br>
