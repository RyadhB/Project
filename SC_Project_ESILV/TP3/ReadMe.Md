Notary Act and Proof of Existence - Project by Maurin Yohan

<br> As you can see the smart contract is very basic it just allows to store a string and this string will be the hash of the notarial document. </ Br>


<br> How to have hash? </ br>
<br> In the long run, there will be a front end part that will allow to file a document, then a middle office part that will allow to hash the document with the hash function SHA256. Finally, a back end party that will recover the hash and will interact with the smart-contract. Finally after using these 3 parts we have the hash stored in the blockchain. Here there is only the smart-contract </ br>


Warning: In no way can you store your document, but it allows you to know if our document has been modified. Just haveher your document and compare the 2 hashes to see if it has been modified.
