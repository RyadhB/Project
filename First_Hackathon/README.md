This project was done by a team of people from Startups and engineering schools at the first hackathon of Start-up Token of October 2017
Micro funding community is a project where a common pot is created within a community to provide for the needs of people in this community.
It works as follows:
- A person asks for a microcredit to finance his project. In addition, he puts an end of vote deadline.
- Other people vote on the project (True / False)
- Once the deadline is reached, the smart contract is launched. It allows to know if the majority voted True, in this case the project is validated.
- Once the project has been validated, the smart contract transfers the money from the common pot to the person who issued the project.

### The voting system is not up to date, it will be in a few days.
