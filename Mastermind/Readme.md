# Mastermind

The Mastermind is a game where the goal is to find the code. In our case this code is chosen by an AI at the beginning of your game.

## Presentation

It is generally in the form of a perforated tray with 10 rows of four holes that can accommodate colored pawns.

The number of pawns of different colors is 6 and the colors are in the original version: yellow, blue, red, green, white, black. There are also black and white pawns used to give directions at each stage of the game.

## Principle

The goal is to discover the four pawns, i.e. their colors and positions. For this, each round, the player must choose 4 pawns where he thinks the correct pawns are concealed.

Once the pawns are placed, the code indicates:
1. The number of pawns of the right color well placed using the same number of black pawns.
2. The number of pawns of the right color, but poorly placed, with the white pawns.
